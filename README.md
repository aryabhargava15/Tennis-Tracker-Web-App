# Tennis-Tracker-Web-App
Public repository of my tennis player tracker web app, written mainly in Python, that allows users to store their own inputted roster of tennis players and track their live stats. Additionally, you can see the scores of live ATP tennis matches/tournaments. The architecture of this project is a web service and it has a backend service connecting to the UltimateTennis REST API, a SQLAlchemy database that the system puts ands reads data to, and it contains the Flask MVC architecture. The frontend was built using HTML/CSS and JavaScript. There are also two JavaScript files that ping the API daily to fetch the tennis data.
